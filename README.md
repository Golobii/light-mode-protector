### <span style="color:#87CEFA" >LIGHT MODE PROTECTOR</span>

Only works on linux for now. (who uses windows anyways)
<br />
This project protects your eyes from burning by lowering your screen brightness when there is too much white on the screen.
Project is still wip so to actually use it you must first run: <code>xrandr | grep " connected"</code> and replace the eDP-1-1 with the output.
<br />
<br />
Before running install requirements.txt and run these commands:

sudo apt install scrot
<br />
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-dev
